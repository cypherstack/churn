# Uniformly Most Powerful Tests for Ad Hoc Transactions in Monero

This repo manages the LaTeX and Python code for the [Cypherstack paper](https://github.com/cypherstack/churn/blob/upload/latex/Churn-final.pdf) "Uniformly Most Powerful Tests for Ad Hoc Transactions in Monero" by BG Goodell, R Salazar, and F Slaughter; majority of work done by BG Goodell, code written by BG Goodell. 

The LaTeX code typesets the paper itself; the Python code is prototype code for numerical parameterization.

This paper is part of an open, iterative research process, and will be regularly updated, with each revision accompanied by a detailed chaingelog. Future versions will include expanded analyses, new findings, numerical parameterizations, additional experiemntal results, refinements to our formal models and their practical applications, corrections, and more. We use version control via GitHub at https://www.github.com/cypherstack/churn and the paper will appear on IACR shortly.
